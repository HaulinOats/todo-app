This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Brett's TodoMVC app

A simple todo app built using `create-next-app` to scaffold a NextJS project with Typescript.

## Getting Started

Run `npm i` at the project root to get dependencies

You can use the command `npm run test` which uses `concurrently` to launch both the development server and `cypress` in parallel
